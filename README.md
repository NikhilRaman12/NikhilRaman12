# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Nikhil Raman  
**Data Analyst | AI Contributor | AgriTech + AI | Open to Remote Roles**

I'm a results-driven Data Analyst with 3+ years of experience in agri-tech research, data validation, and simulation modeling. Iâ€™ve led data-driven initiatives to evaluate crop and pest forecasting models, validate field trial data, and support business decisions with clear visual insights.

Currently transitioning into advanced analytics and AI model evaluation, Iâ€™ve contributed to LLM training workflows including prompt engineering, RLHF, and structured feedback through freelance roles. I combine my domain experience with growing expertise in Python, SQL, Tableau, and Power BI to solve real-world problems and share my learning publicly.
